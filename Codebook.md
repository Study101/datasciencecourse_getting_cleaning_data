Description of abbreviations of measurements

leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.
The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Output: 
Tidydata.R
The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 
10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard 
deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns.
